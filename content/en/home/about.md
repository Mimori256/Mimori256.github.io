My name is Mimori. I live in Japan and study at the University of Tsukuba. I'd like to use this page to introduce myself.

When I was a high school student, I became interested in how a computer works and started learning programming by myself. And I realized my interest in Japanese NLP(Natural Language Processing). That's part of the reason I decided to enter the university.
I also like and study web development. I made several websites and browser extensions for students at the University of Tsukuba.

There are a bunch of things I like other than computer stuff. So I hope you can find everything you want to know about me on this page.
