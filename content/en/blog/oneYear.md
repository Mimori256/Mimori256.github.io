## Introduction
Almost it's been one year since I entered the University of Tsukuba. So I'd like to reflect on the first year of my college life in this post.

## Before entering the university
 There's no more gut-wrenching day than the day of the acceptance announcement. Honestly, I had spent the entire day playing video game since the exam. I never thought I'd pass.  

I applied for SCS(School of Comprehensive Study), which is the department of the University of Tsukuba. One of the main reasons I applied for SCS is that AT FIRST I thought I could take courses freely without restriction. (It turned out that's not the case later)

After the acceptance announcement, I immediately made my Twitter account (it was the first time to create a Twitter account BTW) and send the SCS Twitter account for freshmen to let me in the LINE group. It's just my personal opinion but you should have a Twitter account whether you tweet or not. ~~I almost went to the wrong university hall on the entrance day, but I was saved by a certain kind follower...~~  

My home isn't much far away from the university. So whether to start living alone was the biggest decision for me before entering university. But since I thought most of the classes will be online this year, I ended up not living alone. I'll live in Tsukuba when the situation becomes better.  

## Welcome to university
### Course registration
Everyone says that the first-course registration was so tough and bothersome. But for me, that was not so hard that much. Maybe this is because I already had decided to major in CS before I enrolled, or because the university's learning system might suit me.  

But there's one thing I'm certain: if you have a specific department you want to go to, DEFINITELY you should apply for it, not SCS. Having the stress of transfer and grades for one year was not good for my mental health.

So if you're a student at SCS, you should ask for help from Academic Support Center staff, your senpai, or your friend when you're troubled with course registration or stuff like that. University doesn't wait, unfortunately.  

### Club
Since I'm an introvert nerd by nature. Choosing which club I would join was also a big decision for me. I didn't want to join a club with many people like so-called "Jock." Then I decided to join the chess club, well I hadn't visited other clubs though.   

From the first time I came to the chess club, I found that it was a fitting club for me. I like this type of game, and they were so kind. Please come visit if you're interested in it :D  

By the way. ~~I heard there's a certain club(I know the name but I won't say it in this post) that encourages members to drink even though they're underage. I won't say the detail of it. I was so shocked cuz this type of shit is a thing. (or am I just too pure?)~~  

Anyway, Joining a club is a good thing. Relationships are a very important part of university life!

### Study
Mainly I took math and CS classes this year. Since I like computer stuff and had already studied the basics of college mathematics, these are not that hard. Of course, I took classes like physics, sociology, and stuff like that. And then I realized I'm not a good report writer. I gotta practice writing reports...  

Plus, I kinda regret not applying for ARE (Advance Researcher Experience) this year... Well, I totally didn't know about that. If you have something you want to research, you should apply to it I guess.



## Coding

### Web

Somehow I made some web tools and extensions for students at the University of Tsukuba.  I've made some pages with HTML and JavaScript before, but this year it was the first time I used *modern frameworks* and TypeScript.  I realized TypeScript was very useful. Why I haven't used it before?  

I have met with several people who use my tools and got feedback. I'm so glad, and I will continue to maintain these tools.

### NLP

I read the Word2Vec, BERT, and some NLP papers.  Also, I experimented with sentiment analysis evaluations, etc.  I understood how neural network works by  coding it, but I still don't fully understand these papers.  I have so many things to learn...  

Actually, I want to make my own morphological analyzer, but I need to study more about algorithms.

### Things I want to do in my second year

* Learn Rust
* Read more papers
* Make my own morphological analyzer
* Learn modern web development
* Have fun!

## Misc

### Work

I started a part-time job at a cram school.  I work at the part-time job about twice a week. ~~It ain't much, but it's honest work.~~ At first, I wanted a programming job, but I didn't know where to apply, that's why I started this part-time job.  Surprisingly, this job turned out to be good for me.   

Also, I did an internship during summer vacation. It was so interesting experience, but I realized how difficult it is to complete some project in a group.

### Reading

I read about 35 books during  my first year but for tech books. I mainly read books about linguistics and religion and some novels.  I hope to read more books while I'm a university student.

### Human relationship

I was worried about whether I would be able to make friends, but I managed to make some friends ( idk if they think of me as a friend or not tho)   

I thought some classes like PE were essential in building relationships with others.  There's an opportunity to talk to people in MAST from April, so I want to talk with many people.  

### Language

I think my English skills have improved compared to the last year. Maybe it's because I've read many papers both in class and in my private.    

Since March, I have been talking and playing games in English with various people on discord voice chat, and I'm pretty sure that's improving my English talk skills.  It's interesting to listen to not only native English speakers but also people from many countries.  

I want to learn another language, but I haven't decided what to study...

### Music

I've been practicing piano, but I couldn't spend enough on practicing.    

I uploaded a few instrumental songs created with DAW on YouTube, but I have not been uploading songs lately. I want to study mastering cuz I don't know about the theory of it at all.

### Gaming

I started playing chess, and my current rapid rate is about 1630 on Lichess. I need to do more tactics and opening study.

I haven't been able to play Go recently, so I'd like to if possible.  

I recently started playing Civ6. It's fun af, and I have to be careful not to binge playing it.  

I got sub 50 seconds on 40 lines in Tetris for the first time this year. I want to get sub 40 seconds next...



## Reflection & Goals

I didn't feel that my life had changed drastically by entering university. I want to be more active in a variety of activities.    I am the only one who can control my own life after all.

Since I first started using Twitter last year, I realized that I had to be careful how I used SNS.  It was kinda strange to have others respond to my mumbling. It's interesting, but certainly, it's not good for my mental health. I need to consider how to use it.    

The transfer was tough for me, but I really hope to be able to use the experience for the sake of my kouhai...   

Sometimes I feel I am in the worst situation in my life, but there are people in the world who are struggling to even survive. So,  I want to live a life where I do my best doing what I can without asking for too much.
