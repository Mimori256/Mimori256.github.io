      <description>Introduction Almost it&amp;rsquo;s been one year since I entered the University of Tsukuba. So I&amp;rsquo;d like to reflect on the first year of my college life in this post.
Before entering the university There&amp;rsquo;s no more gut-wrenching day than the day of the acceptance announcement. Honestly, I had spent the entire day playing video game since the exam. I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d pass.
I applied for SCS(School of Comprehensive Study), which is the department of the University of Tsukuba.</description>

      <description>I will be a sophomore of MAST(The College of Media Arts, Science and Technology) of the University of Tsukuba. I fell relieved that the transfer went well. But it&amp;rsquo;s not the end; I gotta study more as a college student who majors in CS.</description>
